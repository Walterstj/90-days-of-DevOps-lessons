# Day 14 Task: Python Data Types and Data Structures for DevOps

## Data Types
Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.

## Data Structures
Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

# Tasks

## 1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.

- Lists and sets are mutable, while tuples are immutable.

- Lists and tuples are ordered, while sets are unordered.

- Sets can contain only unique items, while Lists and Tuples can contain duplicates.

- Lists are created using square brackets [] or and tuples using parentheses (), while sets are created using curly braces {}.

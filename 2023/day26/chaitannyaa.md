# Day 26 Task: Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

  
One of the most important parts of your DevOps and CICD journey is a Declarative Pipeline Syntax of Jenkins
  

## Some terms for your Knowledge

**What is Pipeline -** A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs interlinked in a sequence.

**Declarative:** Declarative is a more recent and advanced implementation of a pipeline as a code.

**Scripted:** Scripted was the first and most traditional implementation of the pipeline as a code in Jenkins. It was designed as a general-purpose DSL (Domain Specific Language) built with Groovy.

# Why you should have a Pipeline

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a  [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile)) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository.  
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

**Creating a  `Jenkinsfile`  and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:**

-   Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.
    
-   Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).


# Pipeline syntax

````groovy
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}
